## Interview Prep


### Likely Questions

- Walk me through your background and how it fits this role.
- Tell me about a tough troubleshooting issue you solved—what was your process?
- How do you prioritize multiple incoming requests or tickets?
- Describe a time you improved a process or automated something.
- How do you communicate with non-technical stakeholders during an incident?
- What’s your approach to documenting work and building repeatable playbooks?
- Tell me about a time you made a mistake—how did you handle it?
- How do you ensure accuracy and avoid assumptions when diagnosing problems?

- Keep claims grounded—no tool name-dropping unless you’ve used it.
